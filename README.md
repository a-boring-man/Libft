# libft

The first project at 42 school is to create a custom C library that includes both rewritten and new functions, such as strjoin, substr, split, and functions for linked lists.

## Bonus

The bonus was the implementation of basics linked list function.

## Usage

simply do ```make``` while in the root of the project and it should create a .a file that you can then use as you wish
